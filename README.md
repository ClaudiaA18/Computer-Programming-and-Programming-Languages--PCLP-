# PCLP Assignment I

- 'problem1.c' - Problem I - Anagrams: You need to read pairs of words, check if they are anagrams, and sort them by degree.
- 'problem2.c' - Problem II - Chess: You have to work with a chessboard and determine how many pairs of bishops are attacking each other and if it's possible to move one of them to avoid the attacks.
- 'problem3.c' - Problem III - Rubikâ€™s Cube: You need to work with a 3x3x3 Rubik's cube and perform various operations on it to achieve the correct results.
- 'problem4.c' - Problem IV - X and 0: You have to work with matrices and perform operations with matrices to determine which one has the highest score in the game of X and 0.

# PCLP Assignment II

The "Biju's Browser" assignment involves developing a search engine and a text-based interface using the ncurses library so that users can search, access, and verify web pages. Here's a brief overview of each task and its main objectives:

## Task 1 - Loading website databases into memory
- Displaying the names, access counts, and page titles in the order from the "master.txt" file.

## Task 2 - Implementing a keyword-based search in the website database
- Displaying the found websites in alphabetical order and, in case of identical titles, sorting them by the number of accesses.

## Task 3 - Implementing an advanced search with options such as word exclusion or exact sequence search on a page
- Displaying the found websites in descending order of access count.

## Task 4 - Checking web pages for authenticity by applying a hash function to the page's content and comparing it with the official checksum
- Displaying the results for the verified sites, indicating whether they are safe or malicious.

## Task 5 - Developing a text-based graphical interface using the ncurses library
- Implementing search pages, results, and displaying web page content.
- Integrating commands for interface navigation.
